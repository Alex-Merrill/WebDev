## Web Development Exercises/Projects

Auth0, RDMBS/RESTAPI - Simplepedia, and RESTAPI - Film Explorer can be run using npm.

If you have npm installed on your machine you can run a local dev server in the command line by navigating to one of the three folders and running this command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If there are any errors, this might be fixed by running 

```bash
npm install
```

within the folder to make sure all dependencies are up to date.
