## Web Development Exercises/Projects

Auth0, RDMBS-RESTAPI-Simplepedia, and RESTAPI - Film Explorer can be run using npm.

You can run a local dev server through the command line by navigating to one of the three folders and running these two commands (You'll need to install Node.js if you don't have it already):

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
