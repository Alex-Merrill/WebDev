Auth0, RDMBS/RESTAPI - Simplepedia, and RESTAPI - Film Explorer can be run using npm.

You can run the local dev server in the command line by navigating to one of the three folders and running this command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If there are any errors, this could be fixed by running 

```bash
npm install
```

within the folder.
